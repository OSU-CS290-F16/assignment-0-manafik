<p>This assignment was a little challenging as it was my first ever experience with html and github. It seems like the language is less strict then something like c or c++ but still has a lot of unique keywords and commands that I need to know. This assignment taught me a lot about those keywords in html as well as github. The github tutorials as well as google search helped me out a lot in this assignment as I needed some overview on how github worked and then some answers to  specific questions regarding html and its keywords. Overall the assignment wasn't too hard but helped me obtain some basic understanding of html and git.</p>
